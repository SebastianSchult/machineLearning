# 📊 Does Education Pay Off? A Socioeconomic Analysis of Income and Education Levels in the U.S.

## 🧠 Project Overview

In this project, I explore the relationship between education level and income using data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The goal is to analyze how education correlates with income across demographic factors such as age, gender, and race – and to build a simple model that can predict income class based on these features.

## 📌 Objectives

- Explore U.S. Census data related to income and education
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize trends and correlations
- Build a machine learning model to predict income class
- Communicate key findings using graphs and markdown

## 🗂️ Dataset

- Source: [UCI Adult Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult)
- Size: ~48,000 records
- Features: age, workclass, education, marital-status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, hours-per-week, etc.
- Target: income (`<=50K` or `>50K`)

## 🔧 Technologies Used
